# EXAM 2 TASKS

Optimizing a portfolio of indices with various constraints. Backtesting multiple asset allocation strategies to find the optimal strategy. 

Explanation of optimal allocation strategy:
A potential explanation for the superior performance of the equally weighted
portfolio can be attributed to its ability to function as a short volatility
strategy. This approach involves the buying of securities that have
demonstrated strong performance, while concurrently selling those that have
displayed weaker performance. As a result of its short volatility strategy,
the equally weighted portfolio generates a volatility risk premium, which can
be a key contributor to its success.

Conversely, the Maximum Sharpe Ratio strategy may be sub-optimal in this
context, as it tends to allocate an excessive amount of assets to
well-performing securities, while neglecting those with poorer performance.
The potential drawbacks of this strategy can be observed in the plot from
Task 2.2, which indicates that it is particularly susceptible to failure in
market crashes.

Although the Minimum Variance Portfolio strategy exhibits strong performance,
it does not match the results of the equally weighted portfolio. Therefore,
it can be inferred that the superior performance of the equally weighted
portfolio may be primarily due to its short volatility strategy.
